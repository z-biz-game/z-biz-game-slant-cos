// The playable state machine: what a tap does, what an undo takes back, when a board counts as
// solved, and what a hint is allowed to say.
//
// Two deliberate bindings to js/engine/slant.js:
//   * the ink lives in the engine's own `st.cell` array, and the win check is the engine's
//     independent `verify()` — written from the rules of the game rather than from this file's
//     bookkeeping — so "the UI said I won" cannot disagree with "every node adds up".
//   * hints are read out of a script the *clues* produced (`solve()`), never out of the player's
//     own marks. A wrong diagonal therefore cannot make the hints agree with the mistake: the
//     engine keeps saying what the numbers actually force.
